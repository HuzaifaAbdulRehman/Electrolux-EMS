# CREATING ER DIAGRAM FOR DBMS PROJECT SUBMISSION

## Method 1: MySQL Workbench (RECOMMENDED for Academic Submission)

### Step 1: Reverse Engineer from Database
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to your database (localhost, electricity_ems)
3. Go to: Database > Reverse Engineer
4. Select your connection, click Next
5. Select "electricity_ems" database, click Next
6. Select all tables (16 tables should appear), click Execute
7. Click Next until diagram appears

### Step 2: Organize the Diagram
1. Auto-arrange: Click "Arrange" > "Auto Layout" (may need manual adjustment)
2. Group related entities:
   - User Management: users, customers, employees
   - Billing: bills, payments, tariffs, tariff_slabs
   - Operations: meter_readings, complaints, work_orders, outages
   - Applications: connection_requests, connection_applications
   - System: notifications, bill_requests, system_settings

### Step 3: Enhance for Academic Submission
1. Show Relationships:
   - 1:N relationships (users -> customers, customers -> bills)
   - Identifying vs Non-identifying relationships
   - Cascade rules (should show CASCADE, SET NULL, etc.)

2. Add Legend/Notes:
   - Add text box with: "Electrolux EMS - 5th Semester DBMS Project"
   - Note: "Normalized to BCNF"
   - Note: "16 Tables, 5 Core Entities"

### Step 4: Export for Submission
1. File > Export > Export as PNG (for report)
2. File > Export > Export as SVG (for high quality)
3. File > Export > Export as PDF (for print)

### Step 5: Save Project
1. File > Save Model As > electrolux_ems_er.mwb
2. Keep this file for modifications

## Method 2: Drizzle Studio (Quick Visual Check)

### Steps:
1. Run: npx drizzle-kit studio
2. Opens in browser at https://local.drizzle.studio
3. Visual representation of schema
4. Can see relationships, but NOT suitable for academic submission
5. Use this for quick verification only

## Method 3: Online Tools (Backup Option)

### dbdiagram.io:
1. Go to https://dbdiagram.io/
2. Paste your SQL schema
3. Auto-generates ER diagram
4. Can export as PNG/PDF

### drawSQL:
1. Go to https://drawsql.app/
2. Import MySQL database or paste SQL
3. Professional ER diagrams
4. Free export

## What Your ER Diagram MUST Show (DBMS Requirements)

1. All 16 Tables (entities)
2. Primary Keys (PK) marked clearly
3. Foreign Keys (FK) with arrows showing relationships
4. Cardinality (1:1, 1:N, N:M)
5. Attributes with data types
6. NOT NULL constraints (marked with *)
7. UNIQUE constraints (marked with U or unique icon)

## Entity Relationships to Highlight:

### Core Relationships:
- users (1) -> (N) customers
- users (1) -> (N) employees
- customers (1) -> (N) bills
- customers (1) -> (N) payments
- customers (1) -> (N) meter_readings
- tariffs (1) -> (N) tariff_slabs
- tariffs (1) -> (N) bills
- bills (1) -> (N) payments
- employees (1) -> (N) meter_readings
- customers (1) -> (N) complaints
- employees (1) -> (N) work_orders

### Normalization Evidence:
- Original: tariffs had slab1_rate, slab2_rate, etc. (1NF violation)
- Normalized: separate tariff_slabs table with foreign key

## Tips for Academic Presentation:

1. Use landscape orientation for better readability
2. Use consistent colors:
   - Core entities: Blue
   - Transactional entities: Green
   - Operational entities: Yellow
   - System entities: Gray
3. Show cascade rules on foreign keys
4. Add a title and your names
5. Include date and course code

## What Professors Look For:

✓ All tables present
✓ Correct relationships with cardinality
✓ Primary and foreign keys clearly marked
✓ Proper normalization evident (no repeating groups)
✓ Professional appearance
✓ Clear labeling
✓ Readable even when printed

RECOMMENDATION: Use MySQL Workbench Method 1 - Most professional and widely accepted in academia.
