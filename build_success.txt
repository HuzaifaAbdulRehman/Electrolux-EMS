====================================

Build Status: SUCCESS (Exit Code: 0)

TypeScript Errors: 0
Build Errors: 0

✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types completed
✓ Generating static pages (85/85) 
✓ Finalizing page optimization
✓ Build completed

Total Routes Built: 85 pages/routes
- Static pages: All admin, customer, and employee pages
- Dynamic API routes: All authentication and data endpoints

BUILD OUTPUT:
The "Dynamic server usage" messages you saw are NOT errors!
They are expected warnings for API routes that use authentication headers.
Next.js is informing you that these routes cannot be pre-rendered statically 
(which is correct and intended behavior for authenticated routes).

YOUR APPLICATION IS READY!

You can now run:
  npm run dev    # Start development server
  npm start      # Run production build (after npm run build)

All TypeScript errors have been resolved!
